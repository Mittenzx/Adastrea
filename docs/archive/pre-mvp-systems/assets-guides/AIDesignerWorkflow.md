## Overview

### What You Can Do (Without C++)

✅ **Create Factions** - Design political/military organizations with unique traits and priorities  
✅ **Create Personnel** - Design individual characters with personalities and skills  
✅ **Create Ways** - Design economic guilds and trade networks (see [Way System Guide](WaySystemGuide.md))  
✅ **Configure AI Behaviors** - Set priorities, relationships, and decision patterns  
✅ **Customize Logic** - Override specific behaviors in Blueprint visual scripting  
✅ **Test and Iterate** - See AI in action and refine behavior  

### What's Already Done (In C++)

✅ Core AI systems and update loops  
✅ Default behaviors for all AI types  
✅ Data structures and properties  
✅ Blueprint hooks and events  
✅ Debug visualization

## The Big Picture

### Three Layers of AI

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. DATA ASSETS (Your Content)          │
│  Factions, Personnel, Stats, Traits     │
│  ↓ References                           │
│  2. LOGIC BLUEPRINTS (Your Behavior)    │
│  Decision making, Priorities, Events    │
│  ↓ Used by                              │
│  3. GAME ACTORS (Your World)            │
│  Ships, Stations, Characters            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How It All Connects

1. **Data Assets** store the facts (who, what, stats)
2. **Logic Blueprints** use data to make decisions (how, when, why)
3. **Game Actors** execute the decisions (actions in world)

---

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Planning (Design Document)

**Before opening Unreal**, answer these questions:

**For Factions:**
1. What's the faction's philosophy? (peaceful, aggressive, mercantile)
2. What are their priorities? (exploration, trade, conquest)
3. Who are their friends/enemies?
4. What unique traits do they have?
5. Are they early-game focused?

**For Personnel:**
1. What's their personality type? (curious, disciplined, empathetic, etc.)
2. What's their role? (captain, engineer, medic, etc.)
3. What are they good at? (skills)
4. How do they handle stress?
5. Who are they friends with?

**Example Faction Planning:**
```
Faction: Peaceful Explorers
Philosophy: Discovery through peaceful means
Priorities: Exploration (9), Trade (7), Diplomacy (8)
Allies: Research Collective, Trade Guild
Enemies: Pirate Clans
Unique: Scientific focus, pacifist
Early Game: Yes - avoid conflict, build alliances
```

### Phase 2: Create Data Assets

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Open Content Browser** in Unreal
2. **Right-Click** → **Blueprint Class**
3. **Choose Parent:** FactionDataAsset or PersonnelDataAsset
4. **Name it** (e.g., `DA_PeacefulExplorers`)
5. **Open and configure** all fields

**Use the YAML templates** as reference:
- Copy values from `Assets/FactionAITemplates/*.yaml`
- Copy values from `Assets/PersonnelAITemplates/*.yaml`

**Pro Tip:** Create several data assets at once, then configure them all. More efficient!

### Phase 3: Create Logic Blueprints

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Right-Click** → **Blueprint Class**
2. **Choose Parent:** FactionLogic or PersonnelLogic
3. **Name it** (e.g., `BP_PeacefulExplorerLogic`)
4. **Open Blueprint**
5. **Assign Data Asset** in Class Defaults
6. **Configure AI Settings:**
   - Disposition (for personnel)
   - Early Game Priorities (for factions)
   - Behavior Mode
   - Update Interval

**Start Simple:** Don't override anything yet! Use default behaviors first.

### Phase 4: Test Default Behavior

**Create a test level:**

1. **Create a simple test map**
2. **Add Faction/Personnel Manager** (Blueprint Actor)
3. **Add your Logic Blueprint** as component
4. **In BeginPlay:**
   ```
   Initialize AI → Update AI (with Tick)
   ```
5. **Run the game**
6. **Watch debug messages**

**What to look for:**
- ✅ AI initializes without errors
- ✅ AI updates every interval
- ✅ Decisions make sense for configuration
- ✅ Debug messages show activity

### Phase 5: Customize Behaviors (Optional)

**Only if needed!** Default behaviors work well.

**When to customize:**
- ❌ Don't like default behavior
- ✅ Want unique faction personality
- ✅ Special scenario needs special logic
- ✅ Want more control over decisions

**How to customize:**

1. **Open Logic Blueprint**
2. **Event Graph**
3. **Right-Click** → **Add Event** → **Event [Function Name]**
4. **Implement custom logic**
5. **Call Parent Function** for default fallback

**Start with ONE event**, test it, then add more.

### Phase 6: Iteration and Polish

**Refine your AI:**

1. **Play the game** with your AI
2. **Take notes** on behavior
3. **Adjust values** in Data Assets
4. **Test again**
5. **Repeat** until satisfied

**Common adjustments:**
- Priority values (too aggressive? lower military priority)
- Update intervals (AI too reactive? increase interval)
- Relationship values (wrong allies? adjust relationships)
- Trait modifiers (not unique enough? add/adjust traits)

## Tips and Best Practices

### Data Asset Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use descriptive names (`DA_PeacefulExplorer` not `DA_Faction1`)
- Use YAML templates as reference
- Start with moderate values, adjust later
- Document unusual values in notes
- Create folders to organize assets

❌ **DON'T:**
- Leave fields at default without reason
- Use extreme values (0 or 10) everywhere
- Copy-paste without customization
- Forget to set Faction/Personnel ID

### Blueprint Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Start with default behaviors
- Override ONE thing at a time
- Test after each change
- Comment your custom logic
- Call Parent Function when appropriate

❌ **DON'T:**
- Override everything (unnecessary!)
- Make complex logic immediately
- Skip testing
- Ignore errors/warnings

### Testing Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Test in isolated environment first
- Use debug messages/prints
- Test edge cases (low morale, high stress)
- Test interactions between AI
- Keep notes on behavior

❌ **DON'T:**
- Test everything at once
- Ignore debug output
- Skip edge cases
- Test in production level first

### Iteration Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Make small changes
- Test after each change
- Keep a changelog
- Ask "does this feel right?"
- Get feedback from others

❌ **DON'T:**
- Change 10 things at once
- Assume first attempt is perfect
- Skip documentation
- Work in isolation forever

### Organization Best Practices

**Folder Structure:**
```
Content/
├── AI/
│   ├── Factions/
│   │   ├── DataAssets/
│   │   │   ├── DA_PeacefulExplorers
│   │   │   └── DA_TradeCoalition
│   │   └── Logic/
│   │       ├── BP_PeacefulExplorerLogic
│   │       └── BP_TradeCoalitionLogic
│   └── Personnel/
│       ├── DataAssets/
│       │   ├── DA_Explorer_Rivera
│       │   └── DA_Security_Chen
│       └── Logic/
│           ├── BP_ExplorerAI
│           └── BP_SecurityAI
```

### Naming Conventions

**Data Assets:**
- Factions: `DA_[FactionName]` (e.g., `DA_PeacefulExplorers`)
- Personnel: `DA_[Role]_[LastName]` (e.g., `DA_Pilot_Martinez`)

**Logic Blueprints:**
- Factions: `BP_[FactionName]Logic` (e.g., `BP_PeacefulExplorerLogic`)
- Personnel: `BP_[Name]AI` or `BP_[Role]AI` (e.g., `BP_ExplorerAI`)

### Performance Tips

⚡ **For good performance:**
- Use appropriate Update Intervals
  - Factions: 5-10 seconds
  - Personnel: 1-2 seconds
- Don't create hundreds of AI at once
- Disable AI for distant/inactive entities
- Use simpler logic for background characters

### Common Pitfalls

🚫 **Avoid these mistakes:**

1. **Not assigning Data Asset** → AI has no data to work with
2. **Forgetting to Initialize** → AI never starts
3. **Not calling Update** → AI doesn't tick
4. **Mismatched IDs** → Relationships don't work
5. **Extreme priority values** → Unbalanced behavior
6. **Overriding too much** → Hard to maintain
7. **No testing** → Broken AI in game
8. **No documentation** → Can't remember what you did
