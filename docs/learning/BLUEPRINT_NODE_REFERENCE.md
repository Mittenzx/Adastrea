## Event Nodes

### What Are Events?

**Events** are the starting points of Blueprint execution. They trigger when specific things happen in your game.

**Visual Appearance:**
- 🔴 **Red header**
- White execution output pin (no input)
- Optional data output pins

---

### Common Event Types

#### Event BeginPlay

**When it triggers**: Once, when the actor spawns in the world

**Use cases:**
- Initialize variables
- Setup initial state
- Spawn child actors
- Register for events

**Example - Trading Ship:**
```
Event BeginPlay
  → Set CurrentCredits = 1000
  → Set CargoCapacity = 10
  → Print "Ship Initialized"
```

**Adastrea Usage:**
- `BP_TradingShip` - Initialize cargo hold
- `BP_TradingStation` - Setup market inventory
- `BP_GameMode` - Initialize economy system

---

#### Event Tick

**When it triggers**: Every frame (typically 60 times per second)

**Use cases:**
- Continuous updates
- Smooth interpolation
- Real-time calculations

**⚠️ Warning**: Use sparingly! Tick is expensive.

**Example - Ship Movement:**
```
Event Tick
  → Get Current Velocity
    → Update Speed Display on HUD
```

**Better Alternative:**
```
Event OnVelocityChanged (custom event)
  → Update Speed Display
```

**Adastrea Usage:**
- Avoid using Tick when possible
- Use timers or event-driven updates instead

---

#### Event OnClicked

**When it triggers**: When UI button is clicked

**Use cases:**
- Button press responses
- Menu navigation
- Confirmation dialogs

**Example - Buy Button:**
```
Event OnClicked (Buy Button)
  → Get Selected Item
    → Get Item Price
      → Check if Player Can Afford
        → Branch
          ├─ True → Buy Item
          └─ False → Show Error
```

**Adastrea Usage:**
- `WBP_TradingUI` - Buy/sell buttons
- `WBP_MainMenu` - Menu buttons
- `WBP_DockingUI` - Interaction prompts

---

#### Custom Events

**When it triggers**: When you manually call it from another part of your Blueprint

**Use cases:**
- Reusable logic
- Communication between Blueprints
- Event-driven architecture

**Example - Cargo Update:**
```
Custom Event: OnCargoChanged
  → Update Cargo Display
  → Check if Overweight
  → Notify Player
```

**How to Call:**
```
Event OnBuyItem
  → Add to Cargo
  → Call Event: OnCargoChanged
```

**Adastrea Usage:**
- `BP_TradingShip` - OnCargoChanged, OnCreditsChanged
- `BP_TradingStation` - OnMarketInventoryUpdated
- `WBP_MarketDisplay` - OnPricesRefreshed

---

## Function Nodes

### What Are Functions?

**Functions** perform actions or calculations and can return values. They have both execution pins and data pins.

**Visual Appearance:**
- 🔵 **Blue header**
- White execution input and output pins
- Colored data input pins (parameters)
- Colored data output pins (return values)

![Function Node](../reference/images/blueprints/function_node.svg)

---

### Common Function Categories

#### Debug Functions

**Print String**

**Purpose**: Display text on screen for debugging

**Parameters:**

- Text Color (Color) - Display color

**Example:**
```
Event BeginPlay
  → Print String: "Game Started!"
    (Duration: 5.0, Color: Green)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use different colors for different message types
- Add context to messages: "Credits: 1000" not just "1000"
- Remove or disable before shipping

---

#### Actor Functions

**Get Actor Location**

**Purpose**: Get the current position of an actor

**Parameters:**
- Target (Actor) - Which actor?

**Returns:**

- Sweep (Boolean) - Check for collisions?

**Example - Respawn Ship:**
```
Event OnPlayerDeath
  → Set Actor Location
    (New Location: SpawnPoint.Location)
```

**Adastrea Usage:**
- Ship spawning
- Teleportation
- Docking alignment

---

**Spawn Actor**

**Purpose**: Create a new actor in the world

**Parameters:**
- Class (Actor Class) - What to spawn?

Event BeginPlay
  → Spawn Actor
    (Class: BP_TradingStation)
    (Location: (1000, 0, 0))
  → Store Reference → StationVariable
```

**Adastrea Usage:**
- Spawning stations during game init
- Creating projectiles (post-MVP)
- Instantiating pickups

---

## Pure Function Nodes

### What Are Pure Functions?

**Pure functions** calculate values without side effects. They have NO execution pins - they only process data.

**Visual Appearance:**
- 🟢 **Green header** (usually)
- NO white execution pins
- Only colored data pins

**Key Difference**: They don't "do" anything, they just calculate!

---

### Math Operations

#### Add / Subtract / Multiply / Divide

**Purpose**: Basic arithmetic

**Parameters:**
- Two numbers (Float or Integer)

**Returns:**
- Result of operation

**Example - Calculate Total Price:**
```
Get Item Price → Multiply (Quantity) → Total Price
```

**Tip**: Chain multiple operations
```
Get Base Price
  → Multiply (Quantity)
  → Multiply (Tax Rate: 1.1)
  → Total with Tax
```

---

### Comparison Operations

#### Greater Than / Less Than / Equal

**Purpose**: Compare two values

**Parameters:**
- A (Number)
- B (Number)

**Returns:**
- Boolean (true/false)

**Example - Afford Check:**
```
Get Player Credits → Greater Than (Item Price) → Can Afford?
  → Branch
    ├─ True → Buy
    └─ False → Error
```

**Common Uses:**
- Validation checks
- Conditional logic
- Threshold detection

---

### Variable Get Nodes

**Purpose**: Read a variable's current value

**Visual Appearance:**
- Light blue oval
- Variable name displayed
- Single output pin

**Example:**
```
Variable: PlayerHealth (Get)
  → Greater Than (0)
  → IsAlive Boolean
```

**Best Practice**: Use Get nodes liberally - they're free (performance-wise)!

---

## Branch and Logic Nodes

### Branch

**Purpose**: Make decisions (if/else logic)

**Visual Appearance:**
- ⚪ White header
- Execution input
- Condition input (Boolean)
- Two execution outputs (True/False)

![Branch Node](../reference/images/blueprints/branch_node.svg)

**Example - Purchase Validation:**
```
Event OnBuyClicked
  → Get Player Credits
    → Greater Than (Item Price)
      → Branch
        ├─ True
        │   → Subtract Credits
        │   → Add to Cargo
        │   → Show Success Message
        └─ False
            → Show "Not Enough Credits" Error
```

**Common Pattern - Multiple Checks:**
```
Branch (Has Cargo Space?)
  ├─ True
  │   → Branch (Can Afford?)
  │     ├─ True → Buy
  │     └─ False → "Not enough credits"
  └─ False → "Cargo full"
```

---

### AND / OR / NOT

**Purpose**: Combine multiple conditions

**AND**: Both must be true
```
Has Credits AND Has Cargo Space → Can Buy
```

**OR**: At least one must be true
```
Is Docked OR Is In Range → Show Trading UI
```

**NOT**: Invert condition
```
NOT Is Dead → Is Alive
```

**Example - Complex Check:**
```
Get Player Credits → Greater Than (Item Price) → A
Get Cargo Space → Greater Than (0) → B

A AND B → Branch
  ├─ True → Allow Purchase
  └─ False → Show Error
```

---

## Flow Control Nodes

### ForLoop

**Purpose**: Repeat an action a specific number of times

**Visual Appearance:**
- 🟠 **Orange header**
- Execution input
- First Index / Last Index inputs
- Loop Body output (executes each iteration)

- Index output (current iteration number)

**Example - Spawn Multiple Stations:**
```
Event BeginPlay
  → ForLoop (0 to 4)
    └─ Loop Body
      → Spawn Actor (BP_TradingStation)
        (Location: Index * 1000, 0, 0)
    → Completed
      → Print "All stations spawned"
```

**Adastrea Usage:**

**Example - Initialize Game:**
```
Event BeginPlay
  → Sequence
    ├─ Then 0 → Setup Economy
    ├─ Then 1 → Spawn Stations
    ├─ Then 2 → Initialize Player
    └─ Then 3 → Show UI
```

**Use Case**: When you need to do multiple things in a specific order

---

### Delay

**Purpose**: Wait a specified time before continuing

**Parameters:**
- Duration (Float) - How many seconds to wait

**Example - Timed Message:**
```
Event OnDocking
  → Print "Docking..."
  → Delay (3.0 seconds)
  → Print "Docking Complete!"
  → Enable Trading UI
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Delays block ONLY that execution path. Other Blueprints continue running.

---

### Gate
