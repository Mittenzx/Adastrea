# Way System Overview

## What Are Ways?

Ways are **small specialized guilds** - groups of people with shared interests, passions, and trade specializations. Each Way focuses on specific industries and has its own quality reputation.

### Examples of Ways

- **Dwarven Mining Way** - Miners who extract ore and raw materials from asteroids
- **Way of Pure Crafters** - Master artisans who create elite-quality spaceship components
- **Scout's League** - Explorers who map new territories and survey systems
- **Freight Haulers Union** - Transport specialists who move cargo between stations

## Core Concepts

### 1. Industry Specialization

Each Way specializes in one or more industries:

- **Mining** - Extract raw materials (ore, gas, ice)
- **Refining** - Process raw materials into usable resources
- **Manufacturing** - Craft components and parts
- **Shipbuilding** - Build and repair spaceships
- **Trading** - Buy and sell goods, merchant services
- **Exploration** - Survey, map, and discover new areas
- **Research** - Develop new technologies and knowledge
- **Agriculture** - Produce food and organic materials
- **Medical** - Healthcare and pharmaceutical services
- **Security** - Protection, escort, and defense services
- **Salvage** - Recovery and recycling of materials
- **Entertainment** - Leisure and cultural services
- **Transport** - Cargo hauling and passenger services
- **Engineering** - Technical services and maintenance
- **Custom** - Unique specialty (define your own)

### 2. Quality Reputation

Ways build reputations for the quality of their work:

- **Basic** - Cheap, functional, gets the job done
- **Standard** - Average quality, fair price
- **Quality** - Above average, reliable
- **Premium** - High quality, expensive
- **Elite** - Exceptional quality, very expensive
- **Legendary** - Best in class, priceless reputation

### 3. Supply Chains

Ways trade with each other to create supply chains:

```
Dwarven Mining Way (produces iron ore)
    ↓ supplies to ↓
Way of Pure Crafters (consumes ore, produces ship parts)
    ↓ supplies to ↓
Shipbuilders Guild (consumes parts, produces ships)
```

### 4. Business Relationships

Ways have business relationships (NOT diplomacy or politics):

- **Partnerships** - Cooperative agreements between Ways
- **Competition** - Business rivalry
- **Resource Sharing** - Joint resource management
- **Trade Agreements** - Negotiated pricing and quantities

## Sector Councils

### What is a Sector Council?

Each sector has a **council** where representatives from local Ways make practical decisions about:

- **Tax rates** (security, infrastructure, administration)
- **Budget allocation** (how collected taxes are spent)
- **Policies** (trade rules, patrol schedules, resource management)

This is **NOT politics** - it's practical administration and governance.

### Council Representation

- Each Way with presence in a sector gets a representative
- Voting weight based on Way's influence and member count
- Decisions made by weighted voting (typically 51% threshold)

### Example: Frontier Sector Council

**Members:**
- Dwarven Mining Way - 15% voting weight (major mining operations)
- Scout's League - 12% voting weight (exploration activities)
- Way of Pure Crafters - 20% voting weight (large manufacturing facility)
- Freight Haulers Union - 10% voting weight (transport hub)
- Medical Services Guild - 8% voting weight (sector clinic)

**Current Taxes:**
- Security Tax: 15% (high due to raider activity)
- Infrastructure Tax: 5%
- Administration Tax: 3%
- **Total: 23% of trade value**

**Budget Allocation:**
- Security/Policing: 60% (protect against raiders)
- Infrastructure: 30% (maintain stations and facilities)
- Emergency Reserve: 10% (disaster preparedness)

**Recent Policy:** Increased patrol frequency in outer asteroid belt

## Player Interaction

### Reputation with Ways

Players build reputation with Ways through:
- **Feats** - Accomplishing legendary deeds
- **Trade** - Regular business dealings
- **Contracts** - Completing jobs for the Way
- **Precepts** - Actions aligned with the Way's values

### Joining Councils

If you start or represent a Way, you can:
- Participate in sector councils
- Vote on taxes and policies
- Negotiate supply contracts
- Build business relationships

### Economic Impact

Your choices matter:
- High taxes = better security but lower profits
- Low security budget = more raiders
- Good relationships = better trade prices
- Quality reputation = higher earnings

## Key Philosophy: No Politics

This system is about:
- ✅ **Practical administration** - Managing sector resources
- ✅ **Business relationships** - Trade and cooperation
- ✅ **Specialization** - Each Way does what they're good at
- ✅ **Supply chains** - Economic interdependence

This system is NOT about:
- ❌ Diplomacy
- ❌ Political maneuvering  
- ❌ Alliances and wars
- ❌ Power struggles

4. Eventually join or form your own Way
5. Participate in sector council decisions

### For Designers

1. Create Way Data Assets with specializations
2. Define what they produce and consume
3. Set quality reputation tier
4. Establish supply chain relationships
5. Add to sector councils with appropriate voting weight
