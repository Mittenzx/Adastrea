Notes: |
  The Sentinel Border Zone is a high-tension area where external threats
  are real and present. Players here will encounter military operations,
  strict security checks, and potential combat scenarios. Good for
  combat-focused players and those interested in military missions.
  
  Council dynamics: Highly unified due to external threat. Military
  representatives have de facto authority during emergencies. Civilian
  Ways accept restrictions as necessary for survival.
