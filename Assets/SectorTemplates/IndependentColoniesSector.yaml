# Independent Colonies Sector Council
# Loosely governed territory with minimal central authority

Identity:
  SectorName: "Free Colonies Region"
  SectorID: FreeColonies
  Description: |
    A sector of independent colonies and stations that value autonomy above all.
    The council exists more as a coordination body than a government. Minimal
    taxation, minimal services, maximum freedom. Each station makes its own
    rules. The council only handles sector-wide emergencies and inter-station
    disputes. Libertarian in spirit.

Notes: |
  The Free Colonies Region is the ultimate frontier experience. Minimal
  law, minimal order, maximum freedom and responsibility. Great for
  players who want to be left alone and make their own way. Dangerous
  due to lack of organized security, but opportunities abound for the
  self-reliant.
  
  Council dynamics: Representatives are fiercely independent and resist
  any expansion of central authority. Meetings are contentious. Emergency
  cooperation only when absolutely necessary. Player could gain significant
  influence with a small investment due to weak central government.
