# Frontier Mining Sector Council
# Rough, independent mining territory with minimal governance

Identity:
  SectorName: "Frontier Mining Territories"
  SectorID: FrontierMining
  Description: |
    A rough-and-tumble mining sector on the edge of civilized space. The council
    is pragmatic and focused on survival. High security spending keeps pirates
    at bay, while low taxes attract independent miners and prospectors. 
    Infrastructure is basic but functional.

Notes: |
  The Frontier Mining Sector is a dangerous but opportunity-rich area.
  High risk, high reward. Good for experienced players who want to mine
  valuable resources while dealing with pirate threats.
  
  Council dynamics: Unified on security needs, debates over whether to
  spend on better infrastructure or keep taxes ultra-low.
