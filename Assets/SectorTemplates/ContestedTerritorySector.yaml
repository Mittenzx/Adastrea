  - PolicyType: InfrastructureFund
    PolicyName: "Partisan Infrastructure"
    Description: |
      Infrastructure spending favors stations controlled by council
      majority. Opposition stations receive minimal funding. Projects
      often half-finished when power shifts.
    PolicyValue: 40
    IsActive: true

Notes: |
  The Disputed Reaches is politically unstable and perfect for intrigue.
  Shifting alliances mean player choices matter significantly. Support
  one Way and antagonize another. Perfect for diplomatic gameplay and
  players who want to play kingmaker or rise to power themselves.
  
  Council dynamics: Extremely contentious with three major power blocs:
  1) Military-Industrial alliance (authoritarian approach)
  2) Corporate-Merchant alliance (capitalist approach)  
  3) Labor-Religious-Independent alliance (populist approach)
  
  Votes often fail. When they pass, it's because two blocs temporarily
  aligned against the third. Player vote could be the deciding factor!
