  LoreNotes: The Phoenix-class earned its name from its ability to resurrect value from the ashes of destroyed vessels. Salvage crews using these ships operate in the dangerous aftermath of battles and disasters, recovering everything from precious metals to classified technology. It's a risky business, but one Phoenix haul can set a crew up for life.
