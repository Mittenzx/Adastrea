  LoreNotes: The Genesis-class represents humanity's boldest dreams of expansion. These massive vessels are mobile worlds, carrying everything needed to establish a thriving colony from scratch. Each Genesis departure is a major event, as it represents thousands of people leaving everything behind to build new lives among the stars. Only a dozen have been built, and each bears the hopes of an entire civilization.
