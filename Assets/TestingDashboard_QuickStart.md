### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ **Don't:** Check off features without testing

✅ **Do:** Use category filters

## Customizing the Dashboard

Want to add your own testable features?

### In Blueprint:

Override `LoadDefaultFeatures`:

```
Event LoadDefaultFeatures (Override)
  ↓
Clear Testable Features Array
  ↓
Create New Feature:
    Name: "My Custom System"
    Description: "Test my custom feature"
    Category: "Custom"
    Tested: False
  ↓
Add to Testable Features Array
  ↓
Repeat for all your features
```

### In C++:

Edit `TestingDashboardWidget.cpp`, function `LoadDefaultFeatures_Implementation()`:

```cpp
Feature.FeatureName = FText::FromString(TEXT("My Feature"));
Feature.Description = FText::FromString(TEXT("Test description"));
Feature.Category = TEXT("MyCategory");
TestableFeatures.Add(Feature);
```

## Integration with Your Workflow

### For Solo Developers

```
1. Open game
2. F12 → Dashboard
3. Check off features as you build them

```

### For QA Teams

```
1. Assign features to testers
2. Each tester uses dashboard
3. Export results at end of day
4. Combine reports for full picture
```

### For Bug Reports

```
When reporting a bug:
1. Note which feature has the bug
2. Add details in dashboard notes
