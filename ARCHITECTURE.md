  - Supply tracking per station
  - Simple demand simulation
  - Price fluctuations
- **Algorithm** (simplified):
  ```
  New Price = Base Price × Station Multiplier × Supply Factor
  Supply Factor = 1.0 + (Recent Sales - Recent Purchases) / 100
  ```

## 📊 Data Flow

### Trading Loop Flow

```
1. Player flies to Station A
   └─▶ Ship movement component

2. Player approaches station
   └─▶ Docking trigger fires
   └─▶ "Press F to dock" prompt appears

3. Player presses F
   └─▶ Ship movement disabled
   └─▶ Trading UI opens
   └─▶ Market inventory loaded

4. Player buys cargo
   └─▶ Credits deducted
   └─▶ Cargo added to ship
   └─▶ Station supply decreased
   └─▶ Price increases slightly

5. Player closes UI (undocks)
   └─▶ Ship movement enabled
   └─▶ Player flies to Station B

6. Player docks at Station B
   └─▶ Trading UI opens
   └─▶ Different prices displayed

7. Player sells cargo
   └─▶ Credits added
   └─▶ Cargo removed from ship
   └─▶ Station supply increased
   └─▶ Price decreases slightly
   └─▶ Profit calculated and displayed

8. Repeat with better margins
```

### Price Update Flow

```
Player Transaction
    ↓
Update Station Supply
    ↓
Recalculate Price
    ↓
Apply Supply Factor
    ↓
Update UI Display
    ↓
Store New Price
```

## 🎮 MVP Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Hardcoded Prototype (Current)

**Approach**: Everything hardcoded in Blueprints for speed

**Items** (hardcoded):
```
Water:    Station A: 10 credits  |  Station B: 15 credits
Food:     Station A: 25 credits  |  Station B: 35 credits
Fuel:     Station A: 50 credits  |  Station B: 65 credits
```

**Ship Stats** (hardcoded):
```
Cargo Capacity: 10 units
Starting Credits: 1000
Flight Speed: 600 units/sec
```

**No Data Assets Yet**: Coming in Phase 2 after validation

### Phase 2: Structured Version (Weeks 5-8)

Convert to Data Assets:
- `UTradeItemDataAsset` - Trade goods
- `UMarketDataAsset` - Station markets
- `USpaceshipDataAsset` - Ship configurations

### Phase 3: Polish (Weeks 9-12)

Add polish and content:
- More ships (3 total)
- More stations (10 total)
- More items (20 total)
- Save/load system
- Sound effects and VFX

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Blueprint Communication

**Event-Driven Architecture**:
- Docking triggers `OnStationEntered` event
- Trading UI calls `OnItemPurchased` event
- Economy updates via `OnPriceChanged` event
- HUD updates via `OnCreditsChanged` event

### Key Blueprint Interfaces

**`BP_SimpleTradingShip`**:
- `GetCurrentCredits()` → float
- `GetCargoSpace()` → int (used/total)
- `AddCargo(ItemName, Quantity)` → bool
- `RemoveCargo(ItemName, Quantity)` → bool
- `AddCredits(Amount)` → void
- `RemoveCredits(Amount)` → bool

**`BP_SimpleStation`**:
- `GetMarketInventory()` → Map<ItemName, Quantity>
- `GetItemPrice(ItemName, IsBuying)` → float
- `UpdateSupply(ItemName, QuantityChange)` → void

**`BP_SimpleEconomy`**:
- `CalculatePrice(Station, Item, IsBuying)` → float
- `RecordTransaction(Station, Item, Quantity, IsBuying)` → void
- `UpdateAllPrices()` → void

## ⚠️ MVP Scope Boundaries

### ✅ IN SCOPE (MVP)
- Basic 3D flight
- 2 stations minimum
- 3-5 trade items
- Simple buy/sell UI
- Basic economy simulation
- Cargo management
- Ship upgrades (cargo capacity)
- Profit tracking

### 🚫 OUT OF SCOPE (Post-MVP)
- ❌ Combat system
- ❌ Exploration mechanics
- ❌ Faction diplomacy (beyond pricing)
- ❌ Crew management
- ❌ Quest system
- ❌ Multiplayer
- ❌ Advanced AI
- ❌ Character walking
- ❌ Procedural generation
- ❌ Complex progression

**Rationale**: Focus on ONE validated gameplay loop before expanding.

- ✅ Can fly between stations (1-2 minutes)
- ✅ Can dock at stations
- ✅ Can buy and sell cargo
- ✅ Prices differ between stations
- ✅ Can track profit/loss
- ✅ 60%+ playtesters say "fun"

**Result**: ✅ **PASSED** - Proceeded to Phase 2 (Structured Version)

### Week 12 Demo Goals
- [ ] 30-minute playable demo
- [ ] 75%+ "had fun" rating
- [ ] 50%+ "would buy" interest
- [ ] No critical bugs

1. **Combat System** - Weapons, targeting, damage
2. **Exploration** - Scanning, discovery, anomalies
3. **Faction System** - Full diplomacy and relationships
4. **Personnel System** - Crew management and AI
5. **Quest System** - Missions and contracts
6. **Advanced Trading** - Complex supply chains

**See [Full Architecture](docs/development/FULL_ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete vision.**

**Remember**: This is a focused MVP to validate market interest. Full vision comes AFTER successful validation.

**Build it. Ship it. Validate it. Then iterate.**
