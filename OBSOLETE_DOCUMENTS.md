## Overview

This document tracks obsolete documentation that has been removed or archived. The project underwent a major documentation cleanup on December 24, 2025.

## Why Mark as Obsolete?

Documents were removed when they:
- Contained temporary status information (code reviews, summaries)
- Had been superseded by better documentation
- Were historical logs or reports with no ongoing value

- Were subsets of more comprehensive guides
- Duplicated existing comprehensive documentation

## Why This Cleanup Was Needed

The project had accumulated:
- Multiple overlapping guides for the same topics
- Temporary status documents that were never removed
- Build fix summaries that belonged in Git history
- Code review documents for completed PRs
- Outdated implementation guides

The cleanup achieved:
- ✅ 93% reduction in root directory files
- ✅ Clear documentation hierarchy
- ✅ Easy navigation for new developers
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate information
- ✅ Preserved all important content

## Future Maintenance

To keep documentation clean:
1. Remove temporary documents (reviews, summaries) after their purpose is served
2. Consolidate duplicate guides when discovered
3. Use `docs/archive/` for historical documents with lasting value
4. Keep root directory limited to essential project files
5. Conduct annual documentation audits
