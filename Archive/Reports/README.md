# Archived Reports

**Date Archived**: January 13, 2026  
**Reason**: Generated reports from one-time tasks

## Overview

This directory contains generated reports from automated tools and one-time analysis tasks. These are preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Files

### content_organization_report.txt

**Purpose**: Report from automated content organization script  
**Generated**: Prior to January 2026  
**Contents**:
- Statistics of asset types (Materials, StaticMeshes, Textures)
- Planned file moves for Content/ folder reorganization
- 227 files analyzed, 226 moves planned

**Status**: One-time analysis completed  
**Archived**: January 13, 2026

**Note**: This report was used to organize the Content/ directory. The task is complete and the current organization is now documented in the project structure.

### YAML_FILES_LIST.csv

**Purpose**: Inventory of YAML template files for content generation  
**Generated**: Prior to January 2026  
**Contents**:
- Spaceship templates (24 files)
- Personnel templates (6 files)
- Mapping to Data Asset types
- Priority classifications

**Status**: Point-in-time snapshot  
**Archived**: January 13, 2026

**Note**: This CSV was used to track YAML templates. For current template information, see:
- `Assets/SpaceshipTemplates/` directory
- `Assets/PersonnelTemplates/` directory
- Individual system documentation in `Assets/`

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These reports are preserved because:
1. They document the project's content organization evolution
2. The CSV shows what templates were available at a specific point in time
3. They may be useful for understanding past decisions
4. They demonstrate the automated tooling capabilities

## Current Alternatives

- **Content organization**: Check the actual `Content/` directory structure
- **YAML templates**: Browse `Assets/` subdirectories directly
- **Asset inventory**: Use Unreal Engine's Content Browser
