## Deprecated Guides 🗑️

   - See: `DEPRECATED_TradingSystemBlueprintGuide.md`

---

## Remaining Guides (Legacy Format) ⚠️

These guides still use the old format but remain functional:

### 1. Homeworld System (`HomeworldBlueprintTemplates.md`)
**Status**: Legacy format, functional
**System**: Faction reputation initialization based on player homeworld
**Priority**: Medium (not MVP-critical)
**Recommendation**: Update when homeworld system is actively developed

### 2. Way Network (`WayNetworkBlueprintExamples.md`)
**Status**: Legacy format, functional
**System**: Economic guild network integration
**Priority**: Low (post-MVP feature)
**Recommendation**: Update when Way system is implemented

### 3. Station Editor (`Assets/BlueprintWorkflowTemplates.md`)
**Status**: Legacy format, functional
**System**: Station building and module management UI
**Priority**: Low (not in MVP scope - stations are pre-built)
**Recommendation**: Update post-MVP when station building is added

---

## Why Some Guides Remain Legacy

**Strategic Decision**: Focus on MVP-critical guides first.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Homeworld & Way Network**: Post-MVP features not in trade simulator scope
2. **Station Editor**: Complex system, MVP uses pre-built stations
3. **Resource allocation**: Better to perfect MVP guides than update unused features

**When to update**:
- Homeworld: When character creation system is implemented
- Way Network: When economic guild system is added post-MVP
- Station Editor: When station building gameplay is added (post-MVP)
