## 🔧 Guide Status Key

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | **Updated** - Follows new template standard |
| 🔄 | **Being Updated** - In progress |

| ⏳ | **Coming Soon** - Planned but not yet written |

## 📖 Documentation Structure

### New Standard (2026+)

All new Blueprint guides follow this structure:

```
1. Overview - What you'll build
2. Prerequisites - What you need first
3. Dependencies - Other Blueprints required
4. Setup - Variables and Functions to create UPFRONT
5. Step-by-Step - Numbered implementation
6. Testing - Verification steps
7. Troubleshooting - Common issues
```

**Key Improvement**: Variables and Functions are listed BEFORE implementation steps, so you know what to create upfront.

### Legacy Guides

Older guides may have:
- Inconsistent structure
- Missing prerequisites
- Variables discovered mid-implementation
- Varying levels of detail

**Migration Plan**: We're updating high-priority guides to the new standard. See [Blueprint Guide Standards](../reference/BLUEPRINT_GUIDE_STANDARDS.md) for details.

## 💡 Tips for Using Guides

### Best Practices

1. **Read the whole guide first** - Don't start implementing before understanding the full scope
2. **Check prerequisites** - Verify you have everything before starting
3. **Create variables/functions upfront** - Don't wait until you need them
4. **Test after each major step** - Catch issues early
5. **Use troubleshooting section** - Don't struggle alone

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Skipping prerequisites** - Leads to errors mid-implementation
- ❌ **Not creating variables upfront** - Have to backtrack
- ❌ **Rushing through steps** - Miss important details
- ❌ **Not testing incrementally** - Hard to debug later
- ❌ **Ignoring expected results** - Don't know if you're on track
