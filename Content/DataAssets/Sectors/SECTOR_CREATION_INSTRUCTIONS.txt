This file provides step-by-step instructions for creating Sector Council
Data Assets in Unreal Engine Editor.

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
1. Unreal Engine project is open
2. You have reviewed the templates in /Assets/SectorTemplates/
3. You have the corresponding Way Data Assets created

STEPS TO CREATE A SECTOR COUNCIL:
----------------------------------

1. NAVIGATE TO THIS FOLDER
   - Open Content Browser
   - Navigate to Content/DataAssets/Sectors/

2. CREATE NEW DATA ASSET
   - Right-click in empty space
   - Select "Miscellaneous" → "Data Asset" (or search for "Data Asset")
   - In the "Pick Data Asset Class" dialog, search for: SectorCouncilDataAsset
   - Select "SectorCouncilDataAsset"
   - Name it: DA_Council_YourSectorName
   - Press Enter to create

3. OPEN THE DATA ASSET
   - Double-click on the newly created asset
   - The Details panel will show all properties

4. CONFIGURE IDENTITY SECTION
   - Sector Name: Enter the sector's display name (e.g., "Core Systems")
   - Sector ID: Enter unique identifier (e.g., CoreSystems)
   - Description: Enter multi-line description of the sector

5. CONFIGURE COUNCIL SECTION
   - Total Seats: Set number of council positions (typically 8-15)
   - Pass Threshold: Set percentage needed to pass votes (51-70 typical)

6. ADD REPRESENTATIVES
   For each Way that has a council seat:
   
   - Click the "+" button on Representatives array
   - Representing Way: Select the Way Data Asset from dropdown
   - Representative Name: Enter the individual's name
   - Voting Weight: Set influence (10-25 typical)
   - Years of Service: Set experience (0-20)
   - Is Player Controlled: Check if this is a player seat
   
   Repeat for each representative

7. CONFIGURE TAXATION
   - Security Tax Rate: Set 0-50 (typical: 5-20)
   - Infrastructure Tax Rate: Set 0-50 (typical: 3-15)
   - Administration Tax Rate: Set 0-50 (typical: 1-10)

8. CONFIGURE BUDGET
   ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Must sum to 100%
   
   - Security Budget Percent: Set 0-100
   - Infrastructure Budget Percent: Set 0-100
   - Emergency Reserve Percent: Set 0-100
   - Treasury Funds: Set starting funds (100,000 to 10,000,000)
   
   Verify: Security% + Infrastructure% + Reserve% = 100%

9. ADD ACTIVE POLICIES (Optional)
   For each policy you want active:
   
   - Click the "+" button on Active Policies array
   - Policy Type: Select from dropdown (SecurityBudget, TradeRegulation, etc.)
   - Policy Name: Enter policy name
   - Description: Enter what the policy does
   - Policy Value: Set effectiveness (0-100)
   - Is Active: Check to activate
   - Enacted Date: Set when policy was enacted
   
   Repeat for each policy

10. SAVE THE DATA ASSET
    - Click "Save" button or Ctrl+S
    - Close the editor window

11. CREATE CORRESPONDING SECTOR MAP ACTOR
    - Open your level in the Level Editor
    - Search Actors: SpaceSectorMap
    - Drag into level at sector center location
    - Select the actor
    - Set Sector Name to match your council's Sector Name
    - Set Description if desired
    - Position at appropriate coordinates

12. TEST THE SECTOR
    - Hit Play to enter play mode
    - Check Output Log for sector initialization
    - Verify no errors
    - Test functions if needed

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
--------------------
□ SectorID is unique (no other sector uses same ID)
□ Budget allocation sums to exactly 100%
□ All Way references point to valid Data Assets
□ Representative voting weights are reasonable (10-25)
□ Pass threshold is between 51-100
□ Tax rates don't exceed 50% individually
□ Treasury funds is positive
□ SpaceSectorMap actor exists in level with matching name

USING TEMPLATES:
---------------
To create sectors from templates:

1. Open the appropriate YAML file from /Assets/SectorTemplates/
2. Follow the steps above
3. Copy values from YAML into corresponding properties
4. Adjust as needed for your specific use case

Available templates:
- CoreSystemsSector.yaml - Safe, balanced
- FrontierMiningSector.yaml - Dangerous frontier
- TradeHubSector.yaml - Commerce hub
- ResearchSector.yaml - Scientific center
- MilitaryBorderSector.yaml - Military zone
- IndependentColoniesSector.yaml - Minimal governance
- ContestedTerritorySector.yaml - Political intrigue

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
-------------------------
✗ Budget not summing to 100%
✗ Duplicate Sector IDs
✗ Invalid Way references
✗ Missing SpaceSectorMap actor in level
✗ Sector Name mismatch between council and map actor
✗ Voting weights that don't make sense (e.g., 100)
✗ Pass threshold over 100 or under 51

EXAMPLE QUICK SETUP:
-------------------
For a basic trading sector:

Identity:
  Sector Name: "Trading Post Alpha"
  Sector ID: TradingPostAlpha
  Description: "Small trading outpost"

Council:
  Total Seats: 8
  Pass Threshold: 55

Representatives: (example)
  1. Merchant Coalition - 18 voting weight
  2. Freight Haulers - 15 voting weight
  3. Station Services - 12 voting weight

Taxation:
  Security: 7%
  Infrastructure: 8%
  Administration: 3%
  Total: 18%

Budget: (sums to 100%)

  Infrastructure: 50%
  Reserve: 15%
  Treasury: 1,000,000
