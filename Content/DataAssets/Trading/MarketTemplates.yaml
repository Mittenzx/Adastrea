# ===================
# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
# ===================

# To create a Market Data Asset in Unreal:
# 1. Right-click in Content Browser
# 2. Create Blueprint Class -> Parent Class: MarketDataAsset
# 3. Name it DA_Market_[StationName]
# 4. Open and fill in properties from this template
# 5. Save

# Market Balance Guidelines:
# 
# Supply/Demand Levels:
# - 0.1-0.5 = Low (station needs this item, high prices)
# - 0.5-1.5 = Normal (balanced prices)
# - 1.5-3.0 = High (station produces this, low prices)
#
# Price Calculation:
# Price = BasePrice * (Demand/Supply) * Markup/Markdown
#
# Example:
# Water at Agricultural Station (Supply: 1.5, Demand: 0.5)
#   Player buys: 10 * (0.5/1.5) * 1.2 = 4.0 credits (cheap!)
#
# Water at Industrial Station (Supply: 0.5, Demand: 1.5)
#   Player sells: 10 * (1.5/0.5) * 0.8 = 24.0 credits (good profit!)
#
# Profit margins should be 30-50% for typical routes
