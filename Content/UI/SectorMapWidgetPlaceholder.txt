MAP SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED - See Assets/MapSystemGuide.md

Two C++ widget classes are now available:

1. UniverseMapWidget - Galaxy-level view of all sectors
   - Grid-based sector organization
   - Exploration tracking and discovery
   - Player location tracking
   - Full Blueprint exposure

2. SectorMapWidget - Detailed individual sector view
   - Sector information and boundaries
   - Object listings within sector
   - Navigation helpers
   - Spawn position generation

To use:
1. Create Widget Blueprint based on UniverseMapWidget (WBP_UniverseMap)
2. Create Widget Blueprint based on SectorMapWidget (WBP_SectorMap)
3. Design the UI layout in Blueprint designer
4. Override BlueprintNativeEvent functions for custom behavior
5. Bind to player controller for map toggle (M key recommended)

See Assets/MapSystemGuide.md for complete documentation, examples, and integration guide.
