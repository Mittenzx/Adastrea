## 📖 Vision & Long-Term Goals

> **Note**: These represent the full vision AFTER successful MVP validation. Current focus is 100% on Trade Simulator MVP.

### Project Vision

**Adastrea** will become an open-world space flight game featuring exploration, combat, station building, crew management, faction diplomacy, and dynamic trading economies—all built on a designer-friendly, data-driven architecture.

### Core Pillars (Post-MVP)

1. **Trading** (MVP focus) - Dynamic markets and profitable trade routes
2. **Exploration** - Discover systems, planets, phenomena
3. **Combat** - Tactical space battles
4. **Construction** - Build modular space stations
5. **Diplomacy** - Navigate faction relationships
6. **Management** - Recruit and manage crew
7. **Narrative** - Procedural and handcrafted stories

### Design Philosophy

- **Gameplay First**: Fun gameplay before infrastructure
- **Data-Driven**: Content via Blueprint Data Assets
- **Designer-Friendly**: Minimal C++ knowledge required
- **MVP Validated**: Build incrementally based on player feedback
- **Community-Focused**: Open source with comprehensive docs

---

## 💻 Current Development Status

### Code Infrastructure (Complete)

The project has 33K+ lines of C++ code implementing 22 game systems. **However**, most systems are deferred pending MVP validation.

**Infrastructure Status**:
- ✅ Build system working (Unreal Engine 5.6)
- ✅ C++ compilation successful
- ✅ Blueprint integration functional
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive
- ⚠️ Content creation minimal (by design)

### Active Systems (MVP Only)

**Currently Being Built**:
- 🔄 Trading System (hardcoded prototype)
- 🔄 Basic Flight Controls
- 🔄 Station Docking
- 🔄 Simple Economy (static prices)
- 🔄 Trading UI

**Code Exists But Deferred**:
- ⏸️ Combat System (5,700+ LOC)
- ⏸️ Navigation/Autopilot (865 LOC)
- ⏸️ Quest System (1,327 LOC)
- ⏸️ Faction Diplomacy
- ⏸️ Personnel/Crew Management
- ⏸️ Save/Load System
- ⏸️ Advanced AI
- ⏸️ And 15+ other systems

**Rationale**: Code quality is excellent, but we need validated gameplay before expanding scope.

### Documentation Status

- ✅ 74K+ words of documentation
- ✅ 30+ system guides (deferred systems)
- ✅ MVP-specific documentation in `docs/mvp/`
- ✅ Organized file structure
- ✅ Clear scope separation (MVP vs Full Vision)

**Recent Cleanup** (January 21, 2026):
- Moved all non-README docs to `docs/` subdirectories
- Created focused MVP architecture document
- Updated roadmap to current week status

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### MVP-Specific Risks

**High Risk**:
- ❌ Week 4 playtest fails (&lt;60% fun) → **Mitigation**: Pivot or redesign loop
- ❌ Can't recruit external testers → **Mitigation**: Use online communities
- ❌ Core loop not fun → **Mitigation**: Rapid iteration based on feedback

**Medium Risk**:
- ⚠️ Technical blockers in Blueprints → **Mitigation**: Simplify approach
- ⚠️ Balance issues (pricing) → **Mitigation**: Rapid iteration
- ⚠️ Scope creep → **Mitigation**: Strict MVP scope enforcement

**Low Risk**:
- ✅ Documentation incomplete → Already comprehensive
- ✅ Build system issues → Working reliably
- ✅ Code quality → High standards maintained

### Post-MVP Risks (If We Proceed)

- Market competition (Elite, X4, Star Citizen)
- Funding challenges
- Content creation bottleneck
- Team scaling issues
- Feature complexity management

**Mitigation**: Only worry about these IF MVP succeeds

---

### Engine & Infrastructure

#### Unreal Engine Updates
- **Current**: Unreal Engine 5.6.1
- **Q2 2026**: Evaluate UE 5.7 upgrade
- **Q3 2026**: Migration to UE 5.7 (if stable)
- **2027+**: Keep current with latest UE5 stable releases
